# Bike Sales Analysis Dashboard

## Problem Statement
The business lacks clear visibility into **which customer segments are most likely to purchase bikes**.
Decisions were previously made without data-driven insights regarding income, age, and commute behavior.


## Objective
Analyze customer data to:
- Identify key factors influencing bike purchases
- Segment customers based on demographics and commute distance
- Support data-driven marketing and sales decisions


## Data Overview
The dataset includes:
- Customer demographics (Age, Gender, Marital Status)
- Income levels
- Commute distance
- Region
- Bike purchase indicator (Yes / No)


## Key Insights
- **Income Impact**: Customers who purchased bikes have a higher average income than non-buyers.
- **Age Segment**: Middle-aged customers represent the highest purchasing group.
- **Commute Distance**: Bike purchases are strongly associated with short to medium commute distances (0–5 miles).
- **Usage Pattern**: Bikes are primarily used for short-distance commuting rather than long-distance travel.


## Business Recommendations
- Target **middle-aged, medium-to-high income customers** in marketing campaigns.
- Position bikes as an efficient solution for **short daily commutes**.
- Focus promotional efforts on regions with higher purchase concentration.
- Maintain strict data cleaning processes to ensure reliable reporting and insights.
